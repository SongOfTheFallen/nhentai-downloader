## Features

* Downloads manga/doujinshi from [nhentai.net](https://nhentai.net).
* Provides a convenient and responsive local web UI.
* Downloading feature in PDF and compressed archive.

## Installation and Usage

### Backend

1. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies used by the scraper:

   ```bash
   pip install httpx beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```

3. (Optional) create `backend/.env` to override the default password:

   ```
   APP_PASSWORD=mysecret
   ```

   The default password is `changeme`.

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server listens on `http://localhost:8787` by default. Set the `PORT`
   environment variable to use a different port.

### Frontend

The `frontend` directory contains only static files. Host them on any web
server. When deploying, ensure `window.API_BASE` in `index.html` points to the
backend URL, for example:

```html
<script>window.API_BASE = 'http://backend.example.com:8787';</script>
```

To run locally you can use:

```bash
cd frontend && npx serve .
```

## Compatibility

This program was developed, tested, and runs with Python 3.13. It is expected to be compatible with Python 3.11 and may also work on Python 3.10, but it will not function correctly on versions earlier than 3.10.

## Project Status

This project is currently experimental. The backend sequentially and synchronously downloads doujinshi starting from the first available entry. Planned improvements include:

* Support for downloading specific or random doujinshi.
* Implementing asynchronous downloading for enhanced performance.
* General backend optimizations for improved functionality.

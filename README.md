## Compatibility

This program was developed, tested, and runs with Python 3.13. It is expected to be compatible with Python 3.11 and may also work on Python 3.10, but it will not function correctly on versions earlier than 3.10.

## Project Status

This project is currently experimental. The backend sequentially and synchronously downloads doujinshi starting from the first available entry. Planned improvements include:

* Support for downloading specific or random doujinshi.
* Implementing asynchronous downloading for enhanced performance.
* General backend optimizations for improved functionality.
